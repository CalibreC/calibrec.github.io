## Black Myth: Wukong Review

I’ve never been so utterly blown away, yet simultaneously so unbelievably frustrated by a game as I have been with Black Myth: Wukong. This is, undoubtedly, one of the most ambitious and impressive action games I’ve played. It’s stunningly gorgeous; its combat is fantastic; it's incredibly challenging, but always satisfying to overcome; and the setting is refreshingly unique and steeped in rich Chinese culture, just to sing a few of its praises. Despite all of that, it often feels like it’s barely holding it all together. I suffered numerous crashes on PC (the PlayStation 5 version wasn't made available for this review), despite having a top-of-the-line setup with a GeForce RTX 4090, not to mention the multiple times I fell through the ground and died just as I was on the verge of defeating a particularly tough boss, or the way characters would randomly switch from English to Chinese, or the way the dialogue audio would drop out all together and leave me completely in the dark during an important cutscene. It’s a rickety roller coaster for sure, and there were definitely spots during the ride where I was not having a great time, but taken as a whole this is one adventure where the bumps are worth it.

我从来没有像《黑神话：悟空》那样被一款游戏如此彻底地震撼，但同时又如此令人难以置信地沮丧。毫无疑问，这是我玩过的最雄心勃勃、最令人印象深刻的动作游戏之一。真是美得惊人；它的战斗非常精彩；这是非常具有挑战性的，但克服它总是令人满意的；这里的环境令人耳目一新，独特，充满浓郁的中国文化，值得赞扬一下。尽管如此，人们常常感觉它几乎无法将所有这些结合在一起。尽管我使用 GeForce RTX 4090 进行了顶级设置，但我还是在 PC 上遭受了多次崩溃（PlayStation 5 版本未在本次评测中提供），更不用说我多次从地上摔下来了。当我即将击败一个特别难对付的Boss时，或者角色随机从英语切换到中文的方式，或者对话音频一起消失并在重要的过场动画中让我完全处于黑暗中时，我就死了。这肯定是一个摇摇晃晃的过山车，在乘坐过程中肯定有一些地方我玩得不太开心，但总的来说，这是一次冒险，其中的颠簸是值得的。

Black Myth: Wukong’s story is somewhat of a follow up to the classic novel Journey to the West by Wu Cheng’en, a book that I only personally know thanks to very loose adaptations like Dragon Ball and [Enslaved: Odyssey to the West](https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/01/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west-review). That surface-level familiarity didn’t help much though, as the interpretation that the developers at GameScience have crafted here is laden with references to characters and events from the novel without doing a great job of bringing you up to speed on who Sun Wukong is or what he encountered on his titular journey. I had to look online to understand who Zhu Bhajie was, what his history with Wukong is, and what the significance of certain encounters were, because otherwise I’d have been completely lost at times.

黑神话：悟空的故事在某种程度上是吴承恩经典小说《西游记》的后续，这本书我个人只知道这本书，这要归功于《龙珠》和[《幻想西游记》](https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/01/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west-review)等非常松散的改编。不过，这种表面上的熟悉并没有多大帮助，因为 GameScience 的开发人员在这里精心制作的解释充满了对小说中的人物和事件的引用，而没有很好地让你快速了解孙悟空是谁。或者他在名义上的旅程中遇到了什么。我必须在网上查找朱巴杰是谁，他和悟空的历史是什么，以及某些遭遇的意义是什么，否则有时我会完全迷失。

You play as The Destined One, a literal monkey who wakes up one morning and decides to set out on a roughly 40-hour journey to locate the six relics of Wukong. While the moment-to-moment storytelling is fairly unremarkable – largely due to a mute protagonist and side characters that aren’t given enough screen time to develop – each of the six self-contained chapters culminates with a stunningly gorgeous animated vignette that tells a short story about that story’s main antagonist. Each one is done in a completely different art style, with one drawn to look like a storybook, another using stop-motion animation, and another done in the style of an anime. Every single one of them is beautiful and poignant, and I couldn’t help but wish that the main story managed to move me in similar ways.

你扮演的是命中注定的猴子，一只真正的猴子，一天早上醒来，决定踏上大约 40 小时的旅程，寻找悟空的六件遗物。虽然即时的故事讲述相当平淡——主要是因为主角和配角沉默寡言，没有足够的屏幕时间来发展——但六个独立的章节中的每一章都以一个令人惊叹的华丽动画小插曲达到高潮，讲述了一个故事。关于该故事主要对手的短篇小说。每一个都是以完全不同的艺术风格完成的，其中一个看起来像故事书，另一个使用定格动画，还有一个以动漫风格完成。他们中的每一个都是美丽而辛酸的，我情不自禁地希望主要故事能够以类似的方式感动我。

My initial read on Wukong was that it was a [soulslike](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-soulslike-games), given the checkpoint system, the stamina bar that governs your actions in combat, and the dodge-heavy fighting style. But as it turns out, Wukong has more in common with traditional action games like what you might expect from [Bayonetta](https://www.ign.com/articles/bayonetta-3-review) developer PlatinumGames than it does with anything FromSoftware has made. Most of the usual soulslike conventions are missing: There is no penalty for death outside of respawning at the nearest checkpoint (no corpse run is required to regain your loot); you don’t use a shared currency to level up your stats and purchase items or upgrades; and while there is gear and stats to consider, you largely just go and swap out the old equipment with the new as opposed to making choices as to what kind of weapon or piece of armor you want to hold on to and upgrade.

我对 Wukong 的最初了解是，它是一个 [类魂](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-soulslike-games)，考虑到检查点系统，控制你在战斗中行动的耐力条，以及重躲避的战斗风格。但事实证明，《悟空》与传统动作游戏的共同点比任何其他游戏都有更多的共同点，比如您可能对 [Bayonetta](https://www.ign.com/articles/bayonetta-3-review) 开发商 PlatinumGames 所期待的游戏FromSoftware 已制作。大多数常见的类似灵魂的约定都缺失了：除了在最近的检查站重生之外，死亡没有任何惩罚（不需要跑尸体来重新获得战利品）；您不使用共享货币来升级您的统计数据以及购买物品或升级；虽然有装备和统计数据需要考虑，但你基本上只是用新装备替换旧装备，而不是选择你想要保留和升级哪种武器或盔甲。

> **It’s more forgiving, but that doesn't mean it’s any less difficult.**
>
> **它更加宽容，但这并不意味着它的难度降低了。**

And even though I’m a big fan of soulslikes, ditching those mechanics feels like the right move for the game that Wukong is trying to be. It’s far more forgiving, focused on keeping you in the action rather than poring over menus or retracing your steps to regain your lost currency after dying, and Wukong is a better, more distinctive game for it.

尽管我是魂类游戏的忠实粉丝，但放弃这些机制对于悟空想要成为的游戏来说似乎是正确的举动。它更加宽容，专注于让你继续行动，而不是仔细阅读菜单或在死后回溯你的步骤以重新获得失去的货币，而悟空是一款更好、更独特的游戏。

To be clear, though, when I say it’s more forgiving I don’t mean that it’s any less difficult than a From-style game. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that between this and [Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree](https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review), I had *more* difficulty getting through Wukong’s toughest challenges (and, no, there aren’t any difficult options). But at the same time those challenges never felt unfair, and overcoming some of the tougher boss fights was always a satisfying combination of learning their attack patterns, figuring out where I could maximize my punishment windows, and tweaking my loadout in ways that made the best use of my chosen powers.

但需要明确的是，当我说它更宽容时，我并不是说它比 From 风格的游戏难度低。事实上，我什至可以说，在这个和[艾尔登法环：黄金树幽影](https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review)，我在解决悟空最艰难的挑战时遇到了“更多”困难（而且，不，没有任何困难的选择）。但与此同时，这些挑战从来不会让人觉得不公平，克服一些更艰难的老板战斗总是一个令人满意的组合，学习他们的攻击模式，找出我可以最大化我的惩罚窗口，并以最好的方式调整我的负载。使用我选择的权力。

Combat in Black Myth: Wukong is simple and elegant, thanks in part to some tools that are really fun to play around with. Success hinges on a delicate balance of twitch reflex-style gameplay mixed with careful resource management that largely revolves around a Focus Meter which builds up when you land hits and perfectly dodge enemy attacks. You gain a Focus point whenever that meter fills up, which you could then spend in the middle of a light attack combo for a “varied combo,” or you can just use a heavy attack on its own for a powerful strike that can be charged even further if two, three, or even four Focus points are consumed all at once.

《黑神话：悟空》中的战斗简单而优雅，部分归功于一些玩起来非常有趣的工具。成功取决于抽搐反射式游戏玩法与仔细资源管理的微妙平衡，资源管理主要围绕焦点计进行，当您击中并完美躲避敌人攻击时，焦点计就会建立。每当该仪表填满时，您就会获得一个焦点，然后您可以将其用于轻攻击组合的中间，以形成“多种组合”，或者您可以仅使用重攻击本身来进行可以蓄力的强大打击如果同时消耗两个、三个甚至四个焦点，情况就更糟了。

You also have access to a small handful of spells, governed by a mana meter, that are versatile enough to be useful in a wide array of situations. The Immobilize spell, for instance, freezes enemies for a short time, allowing you to get in some quick hits and potentially stagger them to allow for even more free damage; Cloud Step turns you invisible and creates a decoy for your enemies to focus on while you break away, heal up, and then hit your foe with a surprise attack that can crit; Rock Solid briefly turns you into a statue that will cause an enemy’s attack to bounce right off of you, giving you an opportunity for a counter-attack; Ring of Fire creates a barrier around you that will initially repel enemies, and grant you some health restoration and enhances any stat altering drinks you may use while standing inside of it; and finally there’s my personal favorite, a Pluck of Many, which lets you make multiple clones of yourself to all gang up on an enemy.

你还可以使用少量由法力计控制的法术，这些法术的用途足够广泛，可以在多种情况下使用。例如，“定身”法术可以在短时间内冻结敌人，让你可以进行快速攻击，并有可能使他们错开，从而造成更多的免费伤害；云步使你隐形，并为你的敌人制造一个诱饵，让你在脱离、治疗时集中注意力，然后用可以暴击的突然攻击击中你的敌人；坚如磐石会短暂地将你变成一座雕像，使敌人的攻击从你身上弹开，给你反击的机会；火环会在你周围创建一个屏障，最初会击退敌人，并为你提供一些健康恢复，并增强你站在其中时可能使用的任何改变属性的饮料；最后是我个人最喜欢的，“多人的勇气”，它可以让你制造多个自己的克隆体，然后联合起来攻击敌人。

Separate from that you’ve also got transformations, which allow you to morph into powerful creatures that you’ve already bested in battle. What’s really cool about these is that they don’t cost any mana (they’re tied to a very lengthy cooldown instead) and they turn you into a totally different character, complete with an all new moveset, special moves that use your focus meter, and more. For example, one of the first bosses you fight is a wolf with a fiery dualblade that has a lightning fast dash attack. When you defeat him, you’ll gain his transformation and be able to do that very same dash attack to your enemies, and once you build up his focus meter, you’ll even get to do a hugely powerful leaping strike that can ignite foes and deal damage over time to them.

除此之外，你还可以进行变形，让你变身为你已经在战斗中击败的强大生物。这些的真正酷之处在于它们不消耗任何法力（它们与非常长的冷却时间相关）并且它们将你变成一个完全不同的角色，完成全新的动作组，使用你的焦点计的特殊动作，等等。例如，你遇到的第一个 Boss 是一只拥有火焰双刃的狼，它具有闪电般的快速冲刺攻击。当你击败他时，你将获得他的转变，并且能够对你的敌人进行同样的冲刺攻击，一旦你建立了他的焦点计，你甚至可以进行强大的跳跃攻击，可以点燃敌人并随着时间的推移对他们造成伤害。

> **There is an excellent blend of different combat options.**

> **不同的战斗选项完美融合。**

And finally there are Spirit Skills, which are earned by defeating certain more powerful versions of enemies and absorbing their essence into your gourd. These are effectively transformations that only last for one attack and are also tied to a fairly lengthy cooldown, but it’s great to be able to, for example, use the Wandering Wight’s powerful headbutt attack to get an extra stagger after immobilizing an enemy. These Spirit Skills can also be leveled up, which makes it so that even early game Spirits never lose their strength as the campaign rolls on.

最后还有精神技能，这是通过击败某些更强大的敌人并将其精华吸收到你的葫芦中获得的。这些都是有效的转变，只能持续一次攻击，并且还需要相当长的冷却时间，但能够使用流浪尸鬼强大的头撞攻击在固定敌人后获得额外的踉跄是很棒的。这些精神技能也可以升级，这使得即使是早期游戏的精神也不会随着战役的进行而失去力量。

It’s an excellent blend of options, especially when mixed with some truly incredible boss fights, and Wukong introduces all of these elements at a thoughtfully measured pace so that I never felt overwhelmed. Make no mistake: The Destined One is extremely powerful, and being in control of him is definitely a heck of a power trip – even beyond the many powers and abilities he has at his disposal, nothing beats the feeling of just slamming a 50-foot bo staff down onto an enemy’s head – but I still had to be smart with how I used my spells due to the fact that mana restoration is actually very difficult.

这是一个完美的选项组合，特别是当与一些真正令人难以置信的 Boss 战斗混合在一起时，悟空以深思熟虑的节奏介绍了所有这些元素，所以我从来没有感到不知所措。毫无疑问：命中注定的人非常强大，控制他绝对是一次巨大的权力之旅——甚至超越他拥有的众多力量和能力，没有什么比猛击 50 英尺高的感觉更好的了。 bo 法杖落到敌人的头上 - 但我仍然必须聪明地使用我的法术，因为法力恢复实际上非常困难。

This is where the resource management aspect of combat comes into play: I had to carefully consider what spells were actually worth the mana cost, whether I should save them for a more difficult second phase of a fight, and whether or not I could capitalize on the opportunity if I were to spend the mana in the first place. For instance, even though its my most powerful spell, I often had to hold off on casting my Pluck of Many spell that duplicates my monkey since it has an extremely high mana cost – if i cast it at a bad time, the boss could simply wipe all of my clones out with an AOE attack before they even got a chance to get some damage in. Sometimes the adjustment I had to make when I was stuck on a boss was a simple change in how I used my abilities, and the act of coming up with a new strategy and having it pay off was always extremely satisfying.

这就是战斗的资源管理方面发挥作用的地方：我必须仔细考虑哪些法术实际上值得法力消耗，我是否应该将它们保存到更困难的战斗第二阶段，以及我是否可以利用它们如果我一开始就花掉法力，就有机会了。例如，尽管它是我最强大的法术，但我经常不得不推迟施展我的猴子的“多拔”法术，因为它具有极高的法力消耗 - 如果我在错误的时间施放它，老板可能会简单地在他们有机会受到伤害之前，我就用 AOE 攻击消灭了我所有的克隆人。有时，当我被困在 Boss 上时，我必须做出的调整就是简单地改变我使用能力的方式，以及行为提出新策略并获得回报总是令人非常满意的。

While boss battles are where Wukong is at its best, there’s also a highly respectable amount of enemy variety in its regular fights. Level design is of the “wide-linear” variety, usually with a clear main path that leads you from checkpoint to checkpoint, but plenty of opportunities to venture off that path to discover optional goodies. The rewards for exploration are great, too: I’ve found rare crafting materials to make new weapons or armor, special enemies that drop a new Spirit Skill, Curio items that I could equip to enhance my build, and treasure chests that might permanently increase my max health, mana, or stamina, all of which made the time I took to find them feel well spent.

虽然 Boss 战是悟空最擅长的地方，但在常规战斗中，敌人的种类也非常丰富。关卡设计属于“宽线性”类型，通常有一条清晰的主路径，引导你从一个检查点到另一个检查点，但也有很多机会离开这条路径去发现可选的好东西。探索的奖励也很丰富：我发现了稀有的制作材料来制造新的武器或盔甲，特殊的敌人会掉落新的精神技能，我可以装备来增强我的构建的古玩物品，以及可能永久增加的宝箱我的最大生命值、法力或耐力，所有这些都让我觉得花时间去寻找它们是值得的。

> **悟空是我玩过的最华丽的游戏之一。**

On top of that, there are several secret boss fights to discover, key items with mysterious uses that I still haven’t figured out, and plenty more reasons to stray from the beaten path and keep an eye constantly scanning the environment. The main one being that Wukong is one of the most gorgeous games I’ve ever played – every environment is brimming with detail, from the chipped pieces of bark on the trees in the forest, to the real-time deformation of the snow as The Destined One moves through it while dragging his staff along. Not only that, but the animation is incredible too, with wonderful touches and flourishes like the way your character will do a little hop step while locked on to an enemy, then change to strafing around them as opposed to just straight on running while keeping their head turned. The music and sound design is fantastic as well, with epic drum-thumping battle themes and melodic flutes and chimes adding to the air of wonder and mystery as you explore the unknown.

最重要的是，还有几场秘密的头目战斗需要发现，关键物品具有我尚未弄清楚的神秘用途，还有更多理由偏离人迹罕至的道路并不断地观察环境。最重要的是，《悟空》是我玩过的最华丽的游戏之一——每个环境都充满细节，从森林里树皮上的碎片，到雪的实时变形。命中注定的人拖着他的法杖穿过它。不仅如此，动画也令人难以置信，有着美妙的触感和华丽，比如你的角色在锁定敌人时会做一点跳跃步骤，然后改为扫射他们周围，而不是直接奔跑，同时保持他们的能力头转过。音乐和声音设计也很棒，史诗般的击鼓战斗主题以及旋律优美的笛子和编钟为您探索未知世界增添了惊奇和神秘的气氛。

All that said, this game would have benefitted from a map, plain and simple. The lands you explore in Wukong are beautiful, no doubt, but they’re far too big and too crammed with secrets to not give you some sort of navigational help, especially the second and third chapters. This, along with the fact that it’s aggravatingly hard to tell what obstacles can actually be climbed over and what’s an invisible wall, can make exploration quite cumbersome. It’s a good thing the rewards are worth it.

话虽如此，这款游戏还是会受益于一张简单明了的地图。毫无疑问，你在《悟空》中探索的土地是美丽的，但它们太大了，充满了秘密，不可能不给你某种导航帮助，尤其是第二章和第三章。再加上很难分辨哪些障碍物实际上可以跨越以及什么是看不见的墙，这使得探索变得相当麻烦。这是一件好事，奖励是值得的。

However, it’s hard not to feel like all of Wukong’s splendor and detail came at a great cost. I experienced numerous crashes, with one particular heartbreaker happening right after defeating an extremely tough boss that I then had to defeat again. Several others were more minor and would typically happen as I was loading up a new chapter or fast traveling to another level, but they eventually add up to a lot of frustration.

然而，我们很难不觉得悟空的所有辉煌和细节都付出了巨大的代价。我经历了无数次崩溃，其中一次特别令人心碎的事情发生在击败了一个极其难对付的老板之后，然后我不得不再次击败这个老板。其他一些问题则更为次要，通常会在我加载新章节或快速旅行到另一个关卡时发生，但它们最终会增加很多挫败感。

In addition to that, several times during important cutscenes, all dialogue audio and subtitles would drop out completely, leaving me without any clue as to what was being talked about and no way to rewatch the cutscene; characters would occasionally switch to speaking in Chinese all of a sudden despite me having the audio set to English; the lipflaps of the English dub do not even remotely match what’s being spoken; and most of the journal entries you find along the way haven’t even been localized yet into English.

除此之外，有几次在重要的过场动画中，所有对话音频和字幕都会完全消失，让我完全不知道在说什么，也无法重新观看过场动画；尽管我将音频设置为英语，但角色偶尔会突然切换为中文；英语配音的口型与所说的根本不相符；你一路上找到的大多数日记条目甚至还没有本地化成英文。

> **I would love to be able to recommend it without the technical caveats.**
>
> **我很乐意能够在没有技术说明的情况下推荐它。**

The worst, though, was one particular fight in which the boss would plunge me down through the ground during the transition to its final phase, only to have me fall through the world once I regained control of my character. This kept on happening to the point where I thought my game was unavoidably bugged and I wouldn’t be able to reach the end, but my insanity of trying the same thing over and over again eventually yielded a different result for no discernible reason.

然而，最糟糕的是一场特殊的战斗，在过渡到最后阶段时，老板会把我从地上摔下来，而一旦我重新控制了我的角色，我就从世界上摔下来了。这种情况不断发生，以至于我认为我的游戏不可避免地出现了错误，我将无法到达终点，但我一遍又一遍地尝试同样的事情的疯狂最终导致了没有明显原因的不同结果。

These are the kinds of technical problems that GameScience will hopefully look to address in post-launch patches – and it’s not outside of the realm of possibility, as even [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review) was eventually whipped into shape after its own buggy launch (another game that conspicuously didn’t let anyone try [its console version](https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-for-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review) before release). I hope those fixes come swiftly, because while I still wholeheartedly think the things Black Myth: Wukong does so right are worth dealing with those problems, I would love to be able to recommend it without those caveats.

GameScience 希望在发布后补丁中解决这类技术问题——这并非不可能，因为即使是[《赛博朋克 2077》](https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review)在发布时也曾存在诸多 bug（这又是一款在发售前不让任何人试玩[主机版](https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-for-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review)的游戏），最终也得到了修复。我希望这些修复能尽快完成，因为虽然我仍然全心全意地认为《黑神话：悟空》做得非常好，值得我们去解决这些问题，但我更希望能够在不考虑这些缺陷的情况下推荐它。

### Verdict

As GameScience’s debut action game, Black Myth: Wukong is mostly a great success, despite some major technical black marks and localization issues that are likely to cause some frustrations at launch. Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as Elden Ring ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style. Not only that, but there are a ton of exciting boss battles, a great variety of enemies, and the world they inhabit is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears. Its story has its moments but relies a bit too much on having prior knowledge of the events of Journey to the West, and it really could have used a map to make its rewarding exploration measure up to the strength of its combat. That said, its strengths more than carry it through, making Black Myth: Wukong a great action game that could be even greater if GameScience can squash the bugs.

作为 GameScience 的首款动作游戏，《黑神话：悟空》基本上取得了巨大的成功，尽管存在一些重大的技术黑点和本地化问题，可能会在发布时造成一些挫败感。战斗非常精彩，这要归功于仔细的资源管理和闪电般快速的抽搐反应游戏的完美平衡，它像《Elden Ring》一样考验着我的技能，尽管它是一款比 FromSoftware 风格更传统的动作游戏。不仅如此，还有大量令人兴奋的头目战斗、各种各样的敌人，他们所居住的世界绝对是一场视觉和听觉的享受。它的故事有其精彩之处，但有点过于依赖对西游记事件的事先了解，而且它确实可以使用地图来使其有益的探索与战斗的强度相匹配。也就是说，它的优势不仅仅在于坚持下去，使《黑神话：悟空》成为一款出色的动作游戏，如果 GameScience 能够消除这些错误，那么这款游戏可能会变得更加伟大。
